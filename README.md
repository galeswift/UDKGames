UDKGames
========

All manner of UDK games/mods.  Specifically, this is a collection of various game modes, weapons, vehicles and other misc stuff I've worked on over the years.

I think some highlights are the portal gun that won 3rd place in the make something unreal contest, an EDF clone that already has over 130 working (and different!) weapons, and a side scrolling shooter template.

The idea is that you clone this repository into a directory, and then copy the UDK install on top of it.  The .gitignore in the depot will ignore most content, so you won't have to worry about conflicts.

If you ever want to contribute, please drop me a line!
